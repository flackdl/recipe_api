If you have ripe summer cherry tomatoes, you can skip the brown sugar. If you\u2019d rather use boneless chicken breasts, reduce the cooking time by about 5 to 7 minutes. This makes a light meal on its own, but you can add rice or crusty bread, and maybe a salad, if you need something more substantial.",

It builds on the classic combination of pasta, butter and cheese with a spoonful of miso paste for complexity. But you could experiment with using any other condiments or spices you have on hand, such as red pesto, curry paste or ground turmeric in place of the miso. To achieve a silky smooth pasta, you\u2019ll need to put your cacio e pepe skills to work: Vigorously toss the pasta, grated cheese and pasta water together to achieve a properly emulsified, silky-smooth sauce. Top with shrimp, edamame, frozen peas or any steamed vegetable. The optional nori or furikake imparts an unexpected flavor of the sea, and it\u2019s worth using if you have it on hand.",

Allowing your florets and stems to sear in an even layer, undisturbed, gives them time to blister without cooking all the way through, so they retain some crunch. While many pasta sauces are finished with starchy pasta water, this one isn\u2019t, since the hot water would strip the broccoli of that color and crunch you worked so hard to achieve. Instead, toss the cooked pasta in the skillet with the broccoli, walnuts and cheese. A drizzle of olive oil and a squeeze of lemon will provide any additional moisture you need.",

No shallots? A small red onion will do. Keep in mind different types of bacon (or other cured pork) will render different amounts of fat. When you add the brussels sprouts, if the skillet starts to look a little dry, add a tablespoon of oil to keep things moving. To achieve a nice mix of crisp leaves and tender cores, tear off some of the loose outer leaves from your brussels sprouts; they will wilt and blister while the more tightly bundled cores will soften and steam.

    "description": "Packed with the intense flavors of garlic, paprika and salt, dried chorizo sets the flavor profile of this pasta. First, the chorizo sears in a skillet to render some of its fat and flavor, then chickpeas, scallions and kale soak up its spices. Salty Manchego cheese maintains the Spanish vibes, but Parmesan or pecorino work equally well. While eight ounces of pasta might not seem like a lot, meaty chickpeas and hearty kale complete the dish.",

    "description": "If you want to get the timing just right on this one \u2014 no wasted time! \u2014 start the sauce a few minutes after you\u2019ve dropped the pasta into the boiling water. Your spinach should be wilted right around the time the pasta is al dente. If that feels too stressful, or the spinach wilts before the pasta is ready, simply turn the heat under the skillet all the way down to low and keep it warm while the pasta finishes. Don\u2019t count this recipe out if you\u2019re not fond of capers. They add a hint of salty brininess without being in-your-face caper-y. A pound of pasta is a lot to toss around, especially with 2 bunches of spinach in the mix, so save that extra quarter-box for your next pot of <a href=\"https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1016031-pasta-e-fagioli\">pasta e fagioli</a>.",

They\u00e2\u0080\u0099re slightly crusty on the outside, custardy on the inside and, because I add mustard and chopped nuts, surprising. The traditional cheese for these is French Comt\u00c3\u00a9 or Swiss Gruy\u00c3\u00a8re, but lately I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve been using shredded sharp American Cheddar, which makes them a tad more tender and gives them a little edge, nice in a morsel that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s meant to whet your appetite. I like these a few minutes out of the oven, but room temperature puffs have legions of fans as well. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s good to know that raw puffs freeze perfectly (pack them into an airtight container as soon as they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re solidly frozen) and bake perfectly from the freezer.

    "description": "This one-pot springtime minestrone combines asparagus, peas and kale with a healthy dose of fresh ginger. The ginger is optional, but it energizes the broth. This recipe is fairly flexible overall: You can swap green vegetables according to taste, use vegetable or chicken stock and toss in any type of short pasta. The pesto and Parmesan swirled in at the end provide brightness and richness, but you could also finish the soup with tapenade, sour cream, ricotta or even a splash of your favorite hot sauce.",

    "description": "Oat porridge for breakfast is often topped with brown sugar and cream. Though sweetened porridge is delicious, a savory approach with oats makes a nice change. Think of oats as a fine substitute for rice \u00e2\u0080\u0094 you don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t always want rice pudding, do you? Steel-cut oats have a nutty whole-grain flavor and retain a nubbly texture, far superior to rolled oats; they pair nicely with savory toppings, for a risotto-like effect. This easy, hearty dish is actually suitable for any time of day, not just morning. If you can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t find za\u00e2\u0080\u0099atar (a splendid spice mix of wild thyme, sumac and sesame used throughout the Middle East), try a sprinkling of toasted ground cumin or a pinch of oregano, or a generous amount of freshly ground black pepper. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s hard to cook a single portion of oats, so make the full batch. Leftovers can be reheated for another day\u00e2\u0080\u0099s breakfast.

Thin it with pasta water and toss it with hot noodles, as seen here, or scrape it into a bowl as a dip for crudit\u00e9s. Spread it onto a thick piece of toast and cover it with sliced radishes, dill and crunchy salt. Use some to drown a softly poached egg, drizzle with olive oil, and eat with a spoon, or to dress warm white beans, then shower them with black pepper and grated cheese. Whatever you do, don\u2019t skip rinsing the broccoli with cold water after you blanch it; the step keeps the spread a vibrant green.",

    "description": "If you like artichokes as much as I do, this recipe, often made at Passover by Jews from Morocco, is for you. You can use fresh or frozen artichokes, though trimming fresh artichokes is worth the effort for their delicate texture. To save waste, boil the trimmed artichoke leaves about 15 minutes until tender in water with a lemon, then enjoy them for lunch, dipping them into an easy sauce of yogurt spiked with a spoonful of Dijon mustard. Easily made in a frying pan, this tagine goes well with couscous, or a quinoa or bulgur pilaf, though that might depend on your Passover traditions, and Moroccan Jews do not allow rice or couscous. The dish can easily be made a day or two in advance and refrigerated or even frozen.",

The spring onions and potatoes make the perfect bed for roasting: They prop up the sausages so they brown instead of steam, and they absorb the sausage drippings while doing so. A spicy, tangy mustard relish cuts the richness of the sausage and offsets the sweetness of the spring onions. Should you have leftovers, they are excellent tucked between slices of toasted bread smeared with plenty of mayonnaise and more mustard.",

I\u2019ve always wanted it tangier, crunchier and, well, I wanted a salad. This is that salad. It\u2019s meant to be more acidic than sweet, but adjust with vinegar and honey as needed to suit your preference.

Seasoning your meat with salt and pepper at least 24 hours in advance will greatly improve the flavor of the finished product. And, if you can spare an extra 24, making them a day ahead of serving will make them even better, with all that braising liquid flavoring the meat as it sits. Finishing with herbs and lemon are hardly a revelation in the braised meat department, but they are especially welcome here. The fresh lemon juice at the end transforms the braising liquid into a bright, brothy, spoonable sauce good enough to drink.",

When ready to serve, remove them from the fridge and using a spoon, scrape off the solidified fat on the top layer. Return the short ribs, covered, to a 325-degree oven until totally warmed through, 30 to 40 minutes. Remove the lid and increase temperature to 425 degrees, and continue to cook, uncovered, to let the short ribs brown a bit on top and reduce the braising liquid, another 35 to 45 minutes.)"

    "name": "Crispy Potato Kugel",
    "description": "At its core, kugel is a casserole. It comes in both savory and sweet varieties, often made with egg noodles and vaguely sweetened. This version, made with potatoes, is decidedly salty and savory, with onions in the mixture and chives to finish. It can best be described as something between a Spanish tortilla and a giant latke; the potatoes are shredded, not sliced, there are eggs but no flour, and it\u2019s got crispy edges and a creamy interior. Sounds dreamy, doesn\u2019t it? The most annoying parts of this kugel are also the most important: grating the potatoes (I use a box grater, but you can use a food processor with the shredding blade) and wringing out their moisture. For that, I use my hands and a colander or strainer to save a kitchen towel or a cheesecloth, but you can use those, if you like. Traditionally made in a casserole-style baking dish, this kugel starts off in a cast-iron skillet, but a stainless-steel skillet would do the job, and honestly so would a baking dish, just know you may be sacrificing that crunchy underside.",

The key to keeping the chicken juicy, tender and something you\u2019re excited to eat is by gently simmering the stock (which will also keep the broth crystal clear rather than muddied). You can pick the meat from the chicken and add it back to the soup if you like, or save for next-day chicken salad.

This pasta is incredibly versatile: You can use any sturdy greens or even broccoli in place of the broccoli rabe, and feel free to swap in whatever pasta shape and canned beans you have on hand.

According to \u201cPaladares: Recipes from the Private Restaurants, Home Kitchens, and Streets of Cuba\u201d by Anya von Bremzen (Abrams, 2017), the shape of the pastel correlates with the filling: Triangular pastels are filled with guava paste and cheese, while rectangular ones are filled with just guava. Versailles, a Cuban restaurant in Miami, follows this rule, but at home, just make them rectangular, and add a swipe of cream cheese if desired. You can find guava paste in bricks at Latin American grocers, or swap in about 1/2 cup jam or preserves for a nontraditional take.",

Classically made with heavy cream, butter and Parmesan, it is an easy sauce that can be whipped up in minutes using staples from the fridge.

    "description": "A simple dish of creamy, thin-skinned beans and broth on toast is easy to make, and a comfort to eat alone or feed a crowd. If you make the beans ahead of time, they can keep in the fridge for 3 days, but may need a splash of water added when you heat them up. The broth is a great way to make use of parmigiano rinds, if you happen to be saving those, but if you don\u2019t have any lying around, you can still make it rich with umami: Whisk a heaped tablespoon of white miso with a little of the bean broth to make it smooth and lump-free, then add it back to the pot. It will add a similar, savory depth. The dish seems plain, but it won\u2019t be if you season the broth well, and garnish each bowl generously with olive oil, grated cheese and herbs, just before you eat it.",

These onions are great thrown into pasta and salads, or served with roasted chicken. The gratin can stand as a veggie main with a zesty salad alongside, as an accompaniment to your protein of choice or as part of a larger spread. Get ahead by making the onions and preparing all your ingredients (except the potatoes) well in advance, so they\u2019re ready to be assembled together before baking.

    "description": "This simple riff on the <a href=\"https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1018343-old-fashioned\">old-fashioned</a> has become a popular way to serve Mr. Black cold brew liqueur in many bars across America. Tom Baker, the founder of Mr. Black, prefers a simple recipe calling for equal parts rye whiskey and Mr. Black, with no sugar or bitters required. But each bar has its own take. This formula, which comes from Peppi\u2019s Cellar, a bar in the NoLIta section of Manhattan, opts for Irish whiskey and a few dashes of orange bitters. The Irish whiskey lends a gentle touch to the drink, softening the kick of the coffee. But, really, with this drink, it\u2019s all about what sort of whiskey you like (bourbon also works), and how much you like that cold brew flavor, so adjust the proportions and ingredients to your taste.",

At the NoMad Bar in Manhattan, it is one of the most popular cocktails on the menu. But Nathan McCarley-O\u2019Neill, the bar director, has put his own stamp on the recipe, including cold brew liqueur, cold brew concentrate and a touch of aquavit. \u201cBy using a concentrate, we reduced the amount of water and dilution being added to the cocktail,\u201d he said. \u201cThis meant that the espresso martini had a distinct freshness to it.\u201d For the NoMad drink, Mr. McCarley-O\u2019Neill makes his own concentrate, but for home bartender purposes, a high-quality purchased brand like Stumptown can be substituted. The drops of saline solution \u2014 a common trick that cocktail bartenders have been employing for more than a decade \u2014 serve to bring out the drink\u2019s innate flavors.",

Van Olphen dresses the noodles in what he calls wafu dressing, which translates roughly as Japanese-style: a sweet-salty vinaigrette of soy, sesame oil, mirin and rice vinegar. I add a little sweet miso for texture and taste, and increase the amount of seaweed in the salad as well. Garnish with sesame seeds or furikake, the Japanese seasoning blend, and you have a superior tuna casserole. It is as good served cold as hot.",

Some cooks like dal soupy, others chunky. There are dals for special occasions, seasoned with charcoal smoke and butter or padded out luxuriously with cream, as well as lighter, leaner dals that can restore you when you\u2019re not feeling well.The flavor of this everyday, Gujarati-style dal comes from the pure nuttiness of split pigeon peas, boiled until tender and bolstered with spices bloomed in hot ghee. This fat-tempering technique, called vaghar in Gujarati, has many names and many uses across the country. In this case, the tempering is a great introduction to the resourcefulness and finesse of Indian home cooks: Just a few tablespoons of carefully seasoned fat, tipped in at the very last moment, transform an entire pot.\u00a0",

    "description": "Many diners in the United States know dosas as the crisp, oversize folds served at South Indian restaurants. But those dosas have a large extended family: dosas from Karnataka made with grated cucumber; dosas from Tamil Nadu made with pearl millet flour; and dosas from Kerala made with jaggery. There are lacy-edged dosas and cakelike dosas, delicate dosas that crumple like hankies, and fat, deeply pocked dosas that break where they\u2019re creased. If you\u2019ve never made dosas at home, a good place to start is this simple rice and urad dal batter. Traditionally, the batter relies on a wild fermentation that flourishes in warm kitchens, but many cooks hack this, reaching for packets of dosa mix or adding yeast to ensure that the fermentation kicks off properly. A powerful blender is crucial to getting a fine, smooth batter. You\u2019ll know it\u2019s ready when it\u2019s very foamy and smells a little sour.\u00a0",

    "description": "A little bowl of simply spiced half-mashed potatoes and onion, glistening with fat, is a standard side dish at bustling restaurants that serve <a href=\"https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1020908\">dosas</a>. It\u2019s also one of the best vegetable dishes \u2014 inexpensive, quick and delicious \u2014 to add to your repertoire as a home cook. The key to these potatoes is water, not fat. Overcooking them just slightly ensures that they\u2019re tender, and that they hold enough moisture so when you drop them into the hot pan, they break up and meld into the saut\u00e9ed onion mix, becoming almost indistinguishable from it. Though aloo masala is great with a hot dosa, it\u2019s a versatile dish that can also work as a side with other meals.",

    "description": "In India, you\u2019re just as likely to have biryani as a lunchtime delivery at the office as you are to see it as a stunning centerpiece at a wedding feast. The dish is pervasive, with many modern interpretations and regional permutations rooted in Muslim communities of the subcontinent. Hyderabad is famous for its style of biryani, which traditionally involves a layer of raw meat and gravy that cooks the rice as it steams in a tightly sealed pot. This Sindhi-style biryani is the one I make for special Sunday lunches and parties. With multiple layers of parcooked rice, fresh herbs, caramelized onion, saffron-infused milk and braised lamb, it\u2019s a project, but a rewarding one.\u00a0Two tips: Meat on the bone isn\u2019t a rule, but it\u2019s consistently better than meat off the bone. Potatoes are welcome; add a pound of small boiled potatoes to the cooked meat if you want to stretch the pot and feed a few extra people.",

Honestly, it didn\u2019t look like much \u2014 a generic yellow cake with a golden top. I think just the very notion of putting Campari and olive oil in a cake is what made people stop and \u201clike\u201d it. And it is a pretty terrific flavor combination: The citrusy bittersweet character of the Campari goes really well with the fragrant oil, to which I also add melted butter for richness, as well as lots of fresh citrus juice and zest. On its own, the cake is a pretty plain-looking thing, but you can dress it up for a party, adding orange segments, berries and dollops of whipped cream or cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche to the top. If you want to go one step further, simmer some Campari and a bit of sugar down to a syrup, and drizzle that all over the cake. It turns the cake more pink and accentuates its boozy flavor.",

    "description": "Kachori started as street food in Rajasthan, where Marwari cooks sealed food in pastry and deep-fried it, making it ideal for the hungry traders doing business at outdoor markets. Kachori can be filled with potatoes, dal and vegetables, but when peas are in season, they make what I consider the pinnacle of the genre. The filling is fresh, green, bright, juicy and lightly seasoned with herbs and lemon, all tucked inside a thin, flaky crust. The dough behaves nothing like pie dough, but somehow achieves the same effect after it\u2019s deep-fried. Though the snack was originally made to be portable and to keep for a long time, these kachori are best the day they\u2019re made.",

And under the government of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, and the surge of pro-vegetarian Hindu nationalism, even the simple practice of serving eggs at school lunch has become fraught. But eggs have long been an important source of nutrition across the country, and form the base of many classic regional dishes. In Andhra Pradesh, this spicy, tomato-rich egg curry would have firmer, more crumbly yolks (boiled for about 11 or 12 minutes), but I like to cook them a little softer (8 minutes, max).",

But it\u2019s also excellent a few hours later, should you want to get all your baking done before your guests arrive. If tarragon isn\u2019t your favorite herb, you can use chives, basil or mint instead. And if you can manage to trim all the asparagus to the same length, this tart will be especially neat and orderly looking.",

Keep the glazes thin so that they\u2019re fluid enough not only to evenly coat the surface and run own the sides of the cake, but also so they combine and marble together to make Instagram-worthy swirls.",

The rustic pie \u2014 a cross between an American open-face pie and a French galette \u2014 is made with a sturdy, rather wet dough. Chill the dough overnight and it will be a dream to work with. The filling is a generous mound of unpeeled, thinly sliced, lightly sweetened apples, flavored with an abundance of lemon juice and zest and, so surprisingly, not a speck of spice. At Circus, the palm-size pies are pentagonal. The dough is lifted up around the apples, pinched and pressed into shape. To learn to make the pastry at home, I watched Circus\u2019s bakers at work. I loved how each had a particular way of forming the pies. But, most of all, I loved that no matter how they shaped them, in the end, they all looked beautiful. My pie looks beautiful and yours will, too.",

    "description": "Boxty, breadlike potato pancakes that originated in Ireland as early as the late 18th century, were created as a resourceful way to transform less-than-stellar potatoes into a hearty side dish. Variations of these crisp, chewy potato pancakes abound, but most involve some combination of mashed potatoes, grated potatoes, flour, baking soda or baking powder; buttermilk or eggs are sometimes added for richness. Popular in pubs but also made at home, they\u2019re typically served as an accompaniment to stews and rich meat dishes. This recipe is adapted from \u201cThe Irish Cookbook\u201d by Jp McMahon (Phaidon, 2020), who serves them in a more modern fashion, with smoked salmon, sour cream and pickled onions, which balance and brighten.",

There is no need to brown the pork first because the meat gets appealingly dark and caramelized while braising in the rich combination of soy sauce and honey. Fresh cilantro, scallions and a squeeze of lime added just before serving bring freshness. This meal is flexible: It works over rice or other whole grains, tossed with noodles or wrapped in lettuce leaves.",

You can use bittersweet or semisweet, bars or chips, depending on what you have on hand, but this recipe is at its best using bar chocolate because of its meltability. A sprinkling of milk chocolate chips before baking is a sweet counterpoint to the rich, complex brownies. Do not overbake them: When the brownies are done, they will appear just set in the center and on the verge of underbaked. They\u2019ll set further as they cool.

The casserole accompanied venison, lefse and talk of the sugar beet harvest outside. I thrilled to the cream-beefy, umami-strong flavors that sat beneath its golden, cobbled exterior, and I loved the way the potatoes soaked up the gravy that pooled below the venison. You could substitute other ground meats for the beef, and other frozen vegetables for the peas or corn, but the tots are mandatory, and I do love the addition of cheese at the end.",

    "description": "This easy, hearty weeknight meal gets a lot of its brawny richness from just a small amount of bacon. The soft, wilted cabbage lends sweetness, while the kimchi (a nod toward <a href=\"https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1018097-kimchi-fried-rice\">bokkeumbap</a>) zips things up. The secret to getting a crackling, crunchy texture is letting the rice sit in the hot oil without touching it until it browns, but using leftover rice also helps. (As the rice dries out, it crisps more easily.) If you\u2019re starting from scratch, just cook 2 cups of dry rice to yield the 6 cups of cooked rice called for here. Then spread the rice out on a baking sheet and let it cool and dehydrate a bit before frying. Be sure to have everything ready and near the stove when before you start. The cooking goes fast, and there won\u2019t be any time to prepare ingredients once you get going.",

    "name": "Gyudon",
    "description": "A popular fast-food dish in Japan, gyudon is a quick-simmered mixture of thinly sliced beef and crisp-tender onions cooked in a sweet soy broth that\u2019s seasoned with fresh ginger. It\u2019s perfectly suited to weeknight cooking because it requires minimal prep, a short ingredient list and less than 30 minutes of active cooking. Gyudon owes its popularity to Yoshinoya, Japan\u2019s first fast-food chain, which was founded in Tokyo in 1899 and became wildly successful in the 1960s serving just this dish. Variations abound \u2014 this recipe borrows heavily from the chef Ivan Orkin\u2019s recipe, as well as one featured in \u201cSimply Bento\u201d by Yuko \u2014 and while some skip the use of dashi, a Japanese stock using bonito flakes and seaweed, the ingredient gives the dish a slight funk that offsets the sweetness of the mirin, sake and ginger. The flavor is subtle, but it\u2019s missed when absent.",

    "description": "This creamy vegetarian pasta is hearty enough for chilly temperatures while still nodding toward spring with the addition of bright-green chard, leeks and fresh herbs. For texture, it\u2019s topped with toasted panko, a garnish that can go many ways: Instead of using nutritional yeast, which adds tangy flavor here, you can melt a finely chopped anchovy with the butter and toss it with the panko. You could also add some ground coriander, Italian seasoning or herbes de Provence. Toasted panko, plain bread crumbs or even crushed croutons are a solid back-pocket trick to add crunch to any pasta, especially the creamiest kind. Don\u2019t skip the tarragon and lemon zest garnish, which add a fresh note to an otherwise-rich dish.",

It should have a dry, shiny, cracked surface, and a tester inserted into the thickest portion should come out with a few moist crumbs attached.
